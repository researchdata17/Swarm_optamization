Swarm Optimization

**Problem Statement**
In a path planning situation, the problem is specified as: an e-puck robot has to move in a static environment where coordinates of starting point A, endpoint B and three static obstacles are known. It is however advised to use an infrared sensor in order to verify that an obstacle is indeed present. The e-puck robot has to move from point A to point B by finding shortest path and reached in a minimum distance or also successfully estimates the obstacles. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to employ Particle Swarm Optimization for Shortest Path Planning Problem while avoiding any obstacle encountered over the botâ€™s path (trajectory).

**Path planning algorithms**
Path planning is used to address issues in various areas, ranging from easy spatial route planning to select a suitable series of action that is needed to achieve a specific objective. These are measured by their computational complexities. The accuracy of the map, number of obstacles and the location of robot defines the feasibility of the real time motion planning. The issue of path planning is linked in topology to the shortest path issue of a path between two nodes. There are different most known algorithm like Dijkstra algorithm Breadth-first algorithm and A* (A Star) algorithm many other optimization algorithms are known [1]. 
For finding an optimum route it usually takes time, so individuals try to find a sub-optimal way to reduce the computing time to an adequate level. In path planning, many ideal algorithms based on evolved computing e.g. PSO and Genetic algorithms (GA) are suggested. These algorithms can discover a viable route through stochastic searches, but it still takes exponential time to discover one that is ideal. 

**Proposed solution **
Since, the obstacles were STATIC only and we needed to travel shortest path from point A to Point B, we mapped the obstacles as repulsion and goal point as attraction by using Meta heuristic technique Particle swarm Optimization

**Optimization and Particle swarm optimization**
Optimization is a science discipline which deals between alternatives with the identification of 
Appropriate solutions to an issue. Optimization techniques are used to find the parameters which provides the minimum and maximum value of the target. These techniques are used for finding parameters for classification algorithm like SVM and neural network. The optimization of swarm has origins in two primary methodologies of components. The links between it and artificial life (A-life), and bird flocking, fish education and theory of swarming, may be more evident. It is, however, also linked to evolutionary calculation and is connected to both genetic and developmental algorithms.

**How PSO works**
 The PSO is influenced by the social and cooperative conduct of the multiple species in the search area in order to meet their requirements.
